                    <h1>Soweto, South Africa</h1>
                        <h2>Soweto: Where My Journey Began</h2>
                            <p>I still remember walking down Vilakazi Street on a golden Sunday afternoon. Music spilled out of a shebeen, kids darted across the road chasing a scuffed soccer ball, and the smell of braai smoke wrapped itself around me like a welcome hug. This is home. This is where my story began, in Soweto.</p>
    
                        <h3>Highlights:</h3>
                                <p><strong>Vilakazi Street & Mandela House:</strong> Standing outside Mandela House felt like standing at the edge of history. On that street, where both Mandela and Tutu once lived, you feel the pulse of resilience. I wasn’t just sightseeing, I was reminded that change begins in ordinary homes, with ordinary people.</p>
                
                                <p><strong>Hector Pieterson Museum:</strong> The museum is quiet, yet powerful. The image of Hector Pieterson in the iconic photograph isn’t just history, it’s a reminder of sacrifice. I left with tears in my eyes and gratitude in my chest.</p>
                
                                <p><strong>Orlando Towers:</strong> From afar, the towers are an explosion of color, giant canvases painted with Soweto’s spirit. Up close, they’re a rush of adrenaline. I didn’t jump (not yet!), but that is the kind of spot where art, sport, and community blend together.</p>
                
                                <p><strong>Kasi Food:</strong> If Soweto had a flavor, it would be shisa nyama smoke, kota crunch, and the sweetness of amagwinya shared with strangers. I ate a plate of grilled meat and pap at a corner joint, where strangers became friends over tomato relish and laughter.</p>

                <h1>Cape Town, South Africa</h1>
                    <h2>Cape Town: Where Mountains Meet the Sea</h2>
                        <p>The first time I saw Table Mountain rising above the city, it felt like a painting had come to life. Mornings started with sea spray drifting along the promenade, afternoons with markets alive with color, and evenings when the mountain turned gold in the sunset. Cape Town isn’t just beautiful, it feels like the earth is showing off.</p>
        
                    <h3>Highlights:</h3>
                            <p><strong>Table Mountain:</strong> Taking the cable car up, the world opened beneath me, ocean, city, vineyards, all in one sweep. The silence at the top is humbling, like the mountain asks you to pause.</p>
                           <p><strong>Robben Island:</strong> Standing in Nelson Mandela’s cell, I felt the weight of resilience. The guide, once a former prisoner, told stories not from history books, but from his own memory.</p>
                            <p><strong>Cape Point:</strong> Where two oceans meet - the wind wild, the cliffs dramatic. I remember holding onto my hat and laughing as the sea roared below.</p>
                            <p><strong>Kalk Bay & Food Markets:</strong> Fresh fish by the harbor, a street musician playing saxophone, kids diving off the pier. Food in Cape Town always came with music and conversation.</p>

                <h1>Paris, France</h1>
                    <h2>Paris: A City That Teaches You to Slow Down</h2>
                        <p>Paris wasn’t about rushing through monuments, it was about pausing. Sipping coffee at a tiny café, watching the Seine shimmer at dusk, hearing a violinist play near the Pont Neuf. Paris made me realize travel isn’t a checklist,  it’s about presence.</p>
    
                    <h3>Highlights:</h3>
                            <p><strong>Eiffel Tower at Night:</strong> I’ll never forget when the lights sparkled - the crowd gasped, strangers smiled at each other. Magic shared by everyone.</p>
                            <p><strong>Louvre & Mona Lisa:</strong> The art was overwhelming, but what stayed with me was a quiet corner where I found a painting I didn’t know, and fell in love with it.</p>
                            <p><strong>Montmartre:</strong> Artists sketching in the square, narrow streets lined with bakeries, the climb up to Sacré-Cœur with Paris stretched beneath me.</p>
                           <p><strong>Food Moments:</strong> Croissants that flaked into my lap, escargot shared nervously, macarons too pretty to eat but too delicious not to.</p>

                <h1>Bangkok, Thailand</h1>
                    <h2>Bangkok: Chaos, Colors, and Hidden Calm</h2>
                        <p>Bangkok hit me with its energy from the moment I landed - tuk-tuks weaving, street stalls sizzling, neon lights flickering against golden temples. Yet in the middle of the chaos, I found stillness, a monk chanting softly inside Wat Pho as the city roared outside.</p>
    
                    <h3>Highlights:</h3>
                            <p><strong>Grand Palace & Wat Phra Kaew:</strong> Walking through gold-covered spires felt like stepping into a dream. The detail, the devotion, overwhelming and humbling.</p>
                            <p><strong>Floating Markets:</strong> Boats piled with mangoes, spices, steaming noodles. I ate pad thai from a bowl passed over water, the taste stays with me.</p>
                            <p><strong>Khao San Road:</strong> Wild, loud, colorful - backpackers, street music, fried scorpions (yes, I tried one). At night it felt like the whole world had gathered on one street.</p>
                            <p><strong>Hidden Calm:</strong> An evening boat ride on the Chao Phraya River - lanterns reflecting on the water, temples glowing, the city softened.</p>
